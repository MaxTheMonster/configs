#+TITLE: Max's Configs

Here are my configurations for my system. 

You may call them dotfiles. 

It is known to work on all three of my active systems:
- Gentoo Linux
- Solus OS
- Arch Linux

* Usage
  I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] for farming symlinks into one central folder.

  Should you wish to use my configs, run:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stow <program name>
  #+END_SRC
  
  Replace `<program name>` with any one of the directories seen in this repository.
  
  e.g.
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  stow i3
  #+END_SRC
